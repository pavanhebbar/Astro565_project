ss transfer in a binary. Using lecture notes (and uing literature if
necessary), justify a selection of initial binaries that can show: (a)
evolution via magnetic braking; (b) GW angular momentum loss; (c) thermal
timescale MT and (d) mass transfer from a red giant donor to a neutron star.
Obtain their evolution using MESA. Discuss period and mass evolution in those 4
binaries. 

Here we simulate the evolution of a 10 Msun star from its ZAMS under the
influence of a 2Msun neutron star. Neutron star is modelled as a point mass
