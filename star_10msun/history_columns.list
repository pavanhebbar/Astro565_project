   ! mixing regions
   
   !  mx1 refers to the largest (by mass) convective region.
   !  mx2 is the 2nd largest.

   !  conv_mx1_top and conv_mx1_bot are the region where mixing_type == convective_mixing.
   !  mx1_top and mx1_bot are the extent of all kinds of mixing, convective and other.

      ! you might want to get a more complete list of mixing regions by using the following
      
      mixing_regions 40
      
      !mixing_regions <integer> ! note: this includes regions where the mixing type is no_mixing.
         ! the <integer> is the number of regions to report
         ! there will be 2*<integer> columns for this in the log file, 2 for each region.
         ! the first column for a region gives the mixing type using the values defined in const_def
         ! the types are no_mixing, convective_mixing, overshoot_mixing, semiconvective_mixing,
         ! and salt_finger_mixing, numbered from 0 to 4.
         ! entries for extra columns after the last region in the star will have an invalid mixing_type value of -1.
         ! the second column for a region gives the m/mstar location of the top of the region
         ! mstar is the total mass of the star, so these locations range from 0 to 1
         ! all regions are include starting from the center, so the bottom of one region
         ! is the top of the previous one.  since we start at the center, the bottom of the 1st region is 0.
         
         ! the columns in the log file will have names like 'mix_type_1' and 'mix_qtop_1'
