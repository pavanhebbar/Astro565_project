! the following lines of the profile contain info for 1 zone per row, surface to center.

   zone ! numbers start with 1 at the surface
   q ! fraction of star mass interior to outer boundary of this zone
   mass
   logR ! log10(radius/Rsun) at outer boundary of zone

   logT ! log10(temperature) at center of zone
   logRho ! log10(density) at center of zone
   logP ! log10(pressure) at center of zone
   luminosity ! luminosity at outer boundary of zone (in Lsun units). Note that it can be negative!
   logL ! log(max(1d-6,L/Lsun))

   !csound ! sound speed
   energy ! internal energy (ergs/g)
   grada ! dlnT_dlnP at constant S
   gradr ! dlnT/dlnP required for purely radiative transport
   eps_nuc ! ergs/g/sec from nuclear reactions (neutrinos subtracted)
   !add_abundances ! this adds all of the isos that are in the current net.
   ! this add only choseb isos
